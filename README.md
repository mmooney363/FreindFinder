# FriendFinder
This application was built by Mike Mooney in February 2018. It is a social app designed to help you meet people with similar beliefs and worldviews. The application asks for your name and a picture to be uploaded. Then the user is asked to rank a series of 10 statements based on how much they agree with them from most to least.

The project was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

The application can be accessed from any modern computer and requires an internet connection. 

The project is web-based and is compatible with most web popular browsers.
